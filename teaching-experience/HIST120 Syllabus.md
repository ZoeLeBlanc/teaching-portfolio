Discussion Section
Participation:   
Participation in weekly discussions is one of the central pillars of the course and all students are required to attend all section meetings, with the exception of outstanding circumstances.  Sections are a venue to discuss the readings and media content, and learn from one another.  Thus, students should be prepared to contribute to what will hopefully be lively discussions. Attending section without participating will not be sufficient to gain full marks.  Many of the topics we will discuss pertain to current events and students are encouraged to feel comfortable in expressing their opinions. However, in tackling such controversial issues, students are reminded to be respectful of others.  Please remember that a discussion section is only as good as those who contribute to it, so please make the effort for the benefit of yourself and everyone else.  

Country Updates:
In the first week of section, all students will be assigned a week to provide the country update for discussion section. Given the contemporary nature of this course, country updates are intended to help us stay current with the latest events of the Arab Spring. Each student will be responsible for a 5-7 minute presentation at the beginning of section where students are intended to summarize some of the latest events in the assigned country. The format for the presentations is up to the student but remember that these updates are meant to be informative and brief, not an essay on the topic. Students are welcome to bring in different medias.

Each week has been assigned the following country:
•   Week Two: Tunisia
•   Week Three: Saudi Arabia and the Gulf
•   Week Four: Iraq
•   Week Five: Libya
•   Week Six: Lebanon
•   Week Seven: Syria
•   Week Eight: Egypt
•   Week Nine: Jordan and Morocco
•   Week Ten: Egypt and Yemen
•   Week Eleven: Algeria and Palestine
•   Week Twelve: Islamic World outside of the Arab World (choose one or two countries either in Africa or Asia and give update on impact of Arab Spring. Possibilities include: Mali, Mauritania, Nigeria, Malaysia, Indonesia, etc…)
•   Week Thirteen: Al-Qa’ida (choose one region where Al-Qa’ida or its affiliates operates and give update. Possibilities include: Al-Qa’ida in the Arabian Peninsula, Al-Qa’ida in the Islamic Maghreb, Taliban, Al-Shabbab, etc…)

Reading Responses via Twitter:
In preparation for each week’s sections, students are required to post at least two responses (whether statement or question) to the week’s readings via twitter. These responses will be discussed in section and must be posted by midnight the Wednesday before section. The section hashtag is #HIST1202 and must be included in the tweet.  Students are encouraged to use the twitter backchannel of the course to post articles or media clips that are relevant to the course. If a student does not post response tweets, the student will not receive full participation marks for discussion section that week.

Students are welcome to use existing accounts or create a new twitter account solely for the course.  If a student decides to tweet under a pseudonym, please inform the section of your username. If a student decides to tweet under an existing account, please make sure the privacy settings are set to public so that we can see your tweets. Remember that these are public posts so please be respectful in your tweets.

Examples of response tweets:
•   “It's interesting to see the intricate balance btwn Nasser's pragmatism and his Arab nationalist feelings play out in the 6-day War #JS256”
•   “hahn pg61: "carter expressed willingness to work with PLO" - surprised to read that. was there a public reaction to this? #JS256”
